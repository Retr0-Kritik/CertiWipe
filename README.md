## .iso Bootable drive
### The Bootable will work the same way as the app bundled with a minimal Linux OS(Arch/Ubuntu) for better sanitization of the disk

## NOTE - The app won't be able to clean HPA/DCO and SSD sectors of Android due to security parameters from Android.
##        For Windows, the app should be booted from the .iso drive for cleaning HPA/DCO and SSD sectors.
